- Calculates percentage of correctly spoken words

#### **Fluency Analysis (20% of total score)**
- Measures consistency of timing between words
- Detects pauses and rhythm irregularities
- Scores based on smooth speech flow

#### **Overall Score**
- Weighted combination of all three metrics
- Color-coded results:
  - 🟢 **80-100%**: Excellent (Green)

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Technologies**
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useRef for state management
- **Web Speech API**: Browser-native speech recognition
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous speech analysis
- **Custom Algorithms**: Levenshtein distance for word matching

### **Key Algorithms**

#### **Word Similarity Matching**
```javascript
// Uses Levenshtein distance to compare spoken vs expected words
// Accepts matches with 70%+ similarity
const similarity = calculateWordSimilarity(spokenWord, expectedWord);
const isMatch = similarity > 0.7;
```

#### **Speed Calculation**
```javascript
// Calculates words per minute and compares to ideal
const wordsPerMinute = (totalWords / totalTimeInSeconds) * 60;
const speedScore = (wordsPerMinute / idealWPM) * 100;
```

#### **Fluency Analysis**
```javascript
// Measures consistency of timing between words
const avgTimeBetweenWords = calculateAverageWordSpacing();
const fluencyScore = 100 - (avgTimeBetweenWords / 100);
```

### **User Experience Features**
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded word highlighting
